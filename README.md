# special-rs

A scientific library for special math functions written in pure Rust inspired by [SciPy].

This is currently being migrated to [qsib-cbie/sci-rs]. Have migrated :
- [X] Combinations and Permutations
- [ ] Factorial, Double Factorial, K-Factorial
- [ ] Gamma Function (real and complex)
- [ ] Error Function (real)
- [ ] Bernoulli, Tangent, and Secant numbers

Currently has
- Factorial, Double Factorial, K-Factorial
- Combinations and Permutations
- Bernoulli, Tangent, and Secant numbers
- Gamma Function (real and complex)
- Error Function (real)
